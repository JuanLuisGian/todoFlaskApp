# todoFlaskApp
I made a simple ToDo list with a  REST API made ,  mongo DB, i program everything in  visual studio code. If you want to refactorize this code, make shure 
that all the libraries are accesible from the Go root directorie(or at least import them from git). I encourge you  to use  a python virtual enviroment  
since you'll use very specific libraries.
